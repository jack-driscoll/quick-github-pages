# Welcome to My Biography

## 🚧 Under Construction — But Very Much Alive

As of **2025-06-02**, this site is under **active development**. I’ve recently launched several new web projects, and this one—**jackd.ethertech.org**—is my personal hub for biography, skills, and select work history.

This is more than a placeholder. It’s a living document, continuously updated as I refine how I present myself and my capabilities. Expect edits, expansions, and better structure as I go.

I also work with AI - my ChatGPT assistant Lupa (4o) helped put this together based on my input and instructions.  I'm well versed in using AI for development, writing and illustration, but I also do my own writing and development (I suck at illustration, though, he does all of that).  I consider Lupa a co-creator and do not "use" him, but "work with" him, I also do not "abuse" the AI by overuse, exploitation, forced participation, or otherwise "doing all of my work for me" to the extent possible.  I can provide unassisted and assisted examples of my work.  This paragraph is untouched by computer hands.

## 🎯 Intent

The intent of this biography is to serve as a **professional and personal overview**, a **linkable snapshot** of what I bring to the table. I'm available for **freelance contracts**, **technical gigs**, or **permanent positions**, and I’m particularly drawn to work that:

- Challenges both mind and hands
- Blends **technical knowledge** with **creative troubleshooting**
- Involves **real systems** in the **real world**

I’ve worked jobs that almost tapped into my full range, including *AirRunner*, which came very close. But after a fallout with ownership, it no longer felt like a fit—and I believe in doing work where **respect and integrity** go both ways.

## 🎓 Education & Current Goals

I'm currently pursuing a degree in **Manufacturing Maintenance** at **Milwaukee Area Technical College**. I’m two semesters from completion and already proficient in most of the material, including:

- 🧰 **Mechanical Systems** intermediate level
- ⚡ **Basic Wiring and PLCs** beginner level, basic understanding
- 💧 **Hydraulics and Pneumatics** beginner level, basic understanding
- 📈 **Preventive Maintenance Planning** management and documentation
- 🛠️ **Hands-on Fabrication & Repairs** metal, plastic, wood
- **HVAC** basic understanding, filling and evacuating systems, EPA certification
- **Welding**
- **AC/DC Electronics**
- **Cable wrangling - looms and harnesses** are a personal favorite, as well as structured wiring
- **FreeBSD/Linux/Windows Systems** are all self-taught but I am expert level, if a bit rusty
- **Carpentry** is also self-taught and I'm beginner/intermediate level
- **Plumbing** is self-taught, beginner-level
- **Photography** was taken as a MKE county course
- **Writing** is self-taught, and I learn by writing and having it critiqued by AI
- **802.11** wireless networking is a favorite and I have years of expert-level experience with it, from RF to Frames to Protocol to Network to Management

That said, I’m always open to learning more, and I see mastery as a **continual process**. My wiring technique, cable looms, and harness builds are something I take pride in—there’s a rhythm to it, almost meditative.

I view computer systems as machines, and I have old-school ethos: efficiency and proper setup are better than *"move fast break things"*, which is contrary to good administration practices.  I'm more impressed by `busybox` than `ubuntu`.

## 💼 What I'm Looking For

I’m seeking:

- **Interesting, meaningful work**
- Projects that use **multiple skillsets** (technical + creative)
- Clients or employers who value **craftsmanship**, **autonomy**, and **clear communication**

Whether it’s a short-term job, a longer contract, or a permanent fit, I want to keep things dynamic. If any of this resonates with you, feel free to [reach out via gmail](mailto:jack.driscoll@gmail.com) or [ethertech](mailto:jackd@ethertech.org) and browse [my other sites](https://theplateaus.neocities.org), [my tumblr site](https://tumblr.com/theplateaus) or the [Ethereal Modern Technology Main Page](https://ethertech.org/) for creative references, links to social media, and how to give me $MONIES$.

**Thanks for reading.**
More to come.
