# Getting Started with Github Pages

## Introduction

- Getting started with GitHub Pages is easier than you think and easier than they
make it seem.  First, download skeleton.zip from my repo.  This will explain
almost everything.

- Next, make a repository, as in [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) follow the instructions up until create your page.

## _config.yml

This is the basics of your website, follow the directions inside, if it says
"replace this with your something" put your something there.

## skeleton.zip

This file has all the files you really *need*.

### LICENSE

Edit this file and replace "YOUR NAME HERE" with your name.

### index.md

Edit this file and replace with your content.  This will be the `index.html`
file, the root of your website.  This is what will show up when you visit
`https://yourname.github.io`

### _posts

Make new posts in this directory, following the examples shown.

### about.md

An about page, linked as yourname.github.io/about/
