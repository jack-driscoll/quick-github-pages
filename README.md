# Getting Started with Github Pages

## Introduction

- Getting started with GitHub Pages is easier than you think and easier than they
make it seem.  First, download skeleton.zip from my repo.  This will explain
almost everything.

- Next, make a repository, as in [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) follow the instructions up until create your page.

- When you have studied the files, which should all be self-explanatory, you can delete the shameless self-promotion file, the two unnecessary posts, and make your own!

That's ***ALL YOU NEED TO GET STARTED WITH GITHUB PAGES***

### _posts

Make new posts in this directory, following the examples shown.

- `2023-11-29-complex.md` is a "complex" "blog post" note it is `layout: post`
- `2023-11-29-permalink.md` is a post with a permalink

### .gitignore

You can also safely ignore this

### _config.yml

This is the basics of your website, follow the directions inside, if it says
"replace this with your something" put your something there.

### about.md

An about page, linked as yourname.github.io/about/

### Gemfile and Gemfile.lock

Some ruby shit, you can ignore these

### 404.html

An error webpage, you need this, but don't need to do anything with it.

### index.md

Edit this file and replace with your content.  This will be the `index.html`
file, the root of your website.  This is what will show up when you visit
`https://yourname.github.io`

### LICENSE

Edit this file and replace "YOUR NAME HERE" with your name.

### page.md

This is an example of a page, it will show up on top as a link titled "A page"

### README.md

This file, literally.

### _config.yml

It's up at the top, after posts, because you start there.
